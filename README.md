# Real-life Event Sourcing Workshop

You won't need to prepare a lot for the workshop, but you need to have the following installed:

- Your favorite IDE or code editor
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included in Docker for Desktop)

You will also need the `docker-compose.yml` file included in this repository.

If you want to use anything else than MongoDB for projections, feel free to change the compose file.

**Please** keep an eye on this repository, before the workshop, I might need to publish come additional information.
